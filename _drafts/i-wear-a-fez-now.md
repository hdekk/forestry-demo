Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

You've swallowed a planet! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
